<h3><a href="http://vlm1.uta.edu/~athitsos/courses/cse4309_fall2020/assignments/">List of assignment due dates.</a></h3>

The assignment should be submitted via <a href="https://uta.instructure.com/">Canvas</a>. 
Submit a file called assignment6.zip, containing the following two files:

<ul>

<li> answers.pdf, for the output that the programming task asks you to 
include. Only PDF files will be accepted. All text should be typed, and 
if any figures are present they should be computer-generated. Scans of 
handwriten answers will NOT be accepted.


</li><li> knn_classify.m, or knn_classify.py, containing your Matlab or 
Python code for the programming part. Your Matlab or Python code should 
run on the versions specified in the syllabus, unless permission is 
obtained via e-mail from the instructor or the teaching assistant. Also 
submit any other files that are needed in order to document or run your 
code (for example, additional source code files).

</li></ul>

These naming conventions are mandatory, non-adherence to these specifications can incur a penalty of up to 20 points.

<p>


</p><p>

Your name and UTA ID number should appear on the top line of both documents.

<h3> Task 1 </h3> 
 
In this task you will implement k-nearest neighbor (k-nn) classification.



<h3> Command-line Arguments </h3>

You must implement a Matlab function or a Python executable file called <tt>neural_network</tt>,
 that uses backpropagation to train a neural network, and then applies 
that neural network to classify test data. Your function should be 
invoked as follows:

<pre>knn_classify(&lt;training_file&gt;, &lt;test_file&gt;, &lt;k&gt;)
</pre>

If you use Python, just convert the Matlab function arguments shown 
above to command-line arguments. The arguments provide the following 
information:

<ul>

<li> The first argument, &lt;training_file&gt;, is the path name of the 
training file, where the training data is stored. The path name can 
specify any file stored on the local computer.

</li><li> The second argument, &lt;test_file&gt;, is the path name of 
the test file, where the test data is stored. The path name can specify 
any file stored on the local computer.

</li><li> The third argument specifies the value of k for the k-nearest neighbor classifier. 

</li></ul>

The training and test files will follow the same format as the text files in the <a href="http://vlm1.uta.edu/~athitsos/courses/cse4309_fall2020/assignments/uci_datasets">UCI datasets</a> directory. A description of the datasets and the file format can be found <a href="http://vlm1.uta.edu/~athitsos/courses/cse4309_fall2020/assignments/uci_datasets/dataset_description.html">on this link</a>.
 For each dataset, a training file and a test file are provided. The 
name of each file indicates what dataset the file belongs to, and 
whether the file contains training or test data. Your code should also 
work with ANY OTHER training and test files using the same format as the
 files in the <a href="http://vlm1.uta.edu/~athitsos/courses/cse4309_fall2020/assignments/uci_datasets">UCI datasets</a> directory.

<p>

As the <a href="http://vlm1.uta.edu/~athitsos/courses/cse4309_fall2020/assignments/uci_datasets/dataset_description.html">description</a> states, <strong>do NOT use data from the last column (i.e., the class labels) as features</strong>. In these files, all columns except for the last one contain example inputs. The last column contains the class label.


</p><p>


</p><h3>Implementation Guidelines</h3>

<ul>

<li> Each dimension should be normalized, separately from all other 
dimensions. Specifically, for both training and test objects, each 
dimension (i.e., each attribute) should be transformed using function 
F(v) = (v - mean) / std, using the mean and std of the values of THAT 
DIMENSION on the TRAINING DATA. To compute the std, use the formula that
 divides by (number of training objects minus 1). If you calculate an 
std equal to 0, have your code detect that case and set std to 1, so 
that you avoid dividing by 0.

<p>

</p></li><li> Use the L<sub>2</sub>
 distance (the Euclidean distance) for computing distances between two vectors.

</li></ul>

<p>


</p><h3> Classification Stage </h3>

For each test object you should print a line containing the following info:

<ul>

<li> object ID. This is the line number where that object occurs in the 
test file. Start with 1 in numbering the objects, not with 0.

</li><li> predicted class (the result of the classification). If your 
classification result is a tie among two or more classes, choose one of 
them randomly. 

</li><li> true class (from the last column of the test file).

</li><li> accuracy. This is defined as follows:

<ul>

<li> If there were no ties in your classification result, and the predicted class is correct, the accuracy is 1.

</li><li> If there were no ties in your classification result, and the predicted class is incorrect, the accuracy is 0.

</li><li> If there were ties in your classification result, and the 
correct class was one of the classes that tied for best, the accuracy is
 1 divided by the number of classes that tied for best.

</li><li> If there were ties in your classification result, and the 
correct class was NOT one of the classes that tied for best, the 
accuracy is 0.

</li></ul>

</li></ul>

To produce this output in a uniform manner, in Matlab you should use: 

<pre>fprintf('ID=%5d, predicted=%3d, true=%3d, accuracy=%4.2f\n', object_id, predicted_class, true_class, accuracy);
</pre>

In Python or other languages, just use whatever equivalent code is 
needed to produce output identical to what the above code would print in
 Matlab.

<p>

After you have printed the results for all test objects, you should 
print the overall classification accuracy, which is defined as the 
average of the classification accuracies you printed out for each test 
object. To print the classification accuracy in a uniform manner, use 
this Matlab line (or equivalent code, if you are not using Matlab): 

</p><pre>fprintf('classification accuracy=%6.4f\n', classification_accuracy);
</pre>

<p>


</p><h3> Output for answers.pdf </h3>


In your answers.pdf document, you need to provide parts of the output 
for some invocations of your program listed below. For each invocation, 
provide:

<ul> 

<li> ONLY THE LAST LINE (the line printing the classification accuracy) of the output by the test stage. 

</li></ul>

In your answers.pdf document, please provide ONLY THE LAST LINE (the 
line printing the classification accuracy) of the output by the test 
stage, for the following invocations of your program:

<p></p><ul> 

<li> Training and testing on the <tt>pendigits</tt> dataset, with k=1.

</li><li> Training and testing on the <tt>pendigits</tt> dataset, with k=3.

</li><li> Training and testing on the <tt>pendigits</tt> dataset, with k=5.

</li></ul>

<p>

</p><h4> Expected Classification Accuracy </h4>

The results are deterministic, and consequently your results should 
match mine. These are the accuracy percentages I got with my 
implementation:

<pre>dataset     k = 1   k = 3   k = 5   runtime 
pendigits   97.43   97.50   97.63   4 seconds
satellite   89.35   90.42   90.45   3 seconds
yeast       49.59   51.89   55.25   1 second
</pre>

In this <a href="http://vlm1.uta.edu/~athitsos/courses/cse4309_fall2020/assignments/assignment6/results">directory of results</a> you can see the full output of my program for each of the cases above.

<h3> Task 1b (Extra Credit, maximum 10 points).</h3>


In this task, you are free to change any implementation options that you
 are not free to change in Task 1. Examples of such options include 
choice of distance function, choice of normalization, or any other 
relevant option for k-nn classifiers. You can submit a Matlab function 
or Python executable called knn_classify_opt, that implements your 
modifications. A maximum of 10 points will be given to the submission or
 submissions that, according to the instructor and GTA, achieve the best
 improvements (on any of the three datasets) compared to the 
specifications in Task 1. In your answers.pdf document, under a clear 
"Task 1b" heading, explain what modifications you made, what results you
 achieved, and what command line arguments to provide your program with 
in order to obtain those results.
